            <p>
              Welcome to an introduction on how to use technology to facilitate education. This website will show you a variety 
              of methods technology that can be used to teach your learners and why technology is an essential tool to keep and 
              use. Technology is vast and can be presented in ways that challenge students who are proficient or can be used with 
              just a surface understanding for technology novices. Technology is used in a variety of ways in a majority of our 
              students home lives. Whether they are using phones at home on social media or playing video games, it is a way to 
              connect with each other and learn material in a interactive way. My personal philosophy of the use of technology 
              is quite simple. Technology reaches students that might have previously been dubbed "unreachable." We have access 
              to an amazing tool that if harnessed properly can change the game for student comprehension of academic content.

            <p>
              Technology will miss the mark every-time if not presented in a way that is accessible to every student. 
              Ways technology can be accessible could include having computer labs within the school and devices signed 
              out to each student. Another challenge in dealing with the use of devices is that much of the necessary 
              resources on the devices include the need for internet access. Most people already have internet in one 
              form or another but providing hot spots to students, allowing them to stay after school to use the school 
              internet or connecting them with resources in the community can allow for each student to have the access 
              necessary to reach the material conveyed within technology. 
            </p>
            <p>
              While economic factors surely are taken into account when determining equatable use, there are other factors 
              that should be considered when determining what technology should be used for your students. Students with 
              exceptionalities should also be able to use the material in a effective way. Technology allows for voice to 
              text so that students that struggle with spelling or writing have an avenue of accurately conveying their 
              points in papers or discussions. The use of video discussions and applications of concepts allows students 
              to be creative and can help students who struggle with written communication express their understanding in 
              a different way. This is also engaging to students that perhaps process material quickly or might not process 
              material at all if not presented in an interesting way. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Lastly, students that are not English speakers may struggle with the vocabulary included in many lessons. 
              Technology can allow you to include things like an interactive word wall that allows students to connect 
              pictures and real life examples to terminology that students may not understand. This also allows students 
              to understand spelling. Additionally, having access to online dictionaries and translation tools will help 
              students to have resources that allow them to gain thorough understanding of the curriculum.

            />
            <p>
              Technology opens us up to many ethical considerations when allowing students to use technology. 
              The three primary ethical obligations I consider to be most important are preventing computer viruses, 
              getting accurate information and not stealing other peoples work as their own. It is essential that we as 
              educators are giving students boundaries that allow them to function in a safe and productive environment. 
              For this purpose, every student should be given the rules of safe use prior to having independent access to 
              technology. Students should also be held accountable for their behavior when using technology by signing their 
              own behavioral contracts that state they will follow the stated rules. 
            </p>
            <p>
              For students to move about the World Wide Web fluidly while protecting the devices they have been given, 
              students should only be allowed access to safe sites and anything not allowable should be blocked from 
              student use. Additionally computers should be set with anti virus protection software to help combat any 
              potential infection. Another factor to consider when giving students independent access to technology is 
              how they get their information. Students being asked questions on an exit ticket should not be allowed to 
              go over to google and type the question in. There should be clear rules on how to complete these assignments 
              and if research is necessary to the assignment it should be clear the type of websites that will have reputable 
              information. Lastly, when students are doing the research necessary to complete assignments, they might be 
              tempted to just copy and paste. But plagiarism is unethical and students must be equipped with the skills 
              necessary to correctly site the information they are using.

            />
            <p>
              When students are using technology they often don't recognize the amount of power in their hands. Social responsibility 
              is multi faceted in that students should be recognizing that they have to support each other by not being a participant 
              in cyber bullying. But, also recognizing that they can literally change someone's life with the right Initiative. It is 
              essential that students are learning about the potency of the tool they will wield. This can happen by teaching a lesson 
              surrounding the ins and outs of responsible use and how their actions can impact others.
