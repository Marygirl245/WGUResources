              Keeping students accountable and on task has always been a challenge in the classroom. Teachers have used resources 
              such as battery operated kitchen timers, token economy and even posted visual supports of what “on task” behavior 
              should look like. When using technology you have the flexibility of adding aids to your activities as well. You can 
              clearly post due dates on their personal calendars if using programs like canvas. When you submit an assignment the 
              posting on the calendar gets crossed out so that students know it is completed. Timers can be added to quizzes and 
              games so that students are staying on task throughout the activity. Many of the games and quizzes that can be added 
              for the students to complete have built in reinforcers when students complete different phases of the assignment. 
              This acts much like a token economy in that when they complete a certain number of questions something fun or 
              interactive happens. They can even earn online stickers. The options for developing content that encourages students 
              to independently complete tasks and to hold themselves accountable for completing tasks are robust. One specific 
              resource I like to use is Kahn academy. Teachers are able to login and actually assign specific topics to students 
              for them to learn on their own. This allows students to be completely self directed and independent when learning 
              the material.
            </p>
            <p>
              Epic! Is an additional tool that can be used to assist students with self directed learning. This is an application 
              free for teachers that allows them to set goals for students such as a certain number of books to read. Then it 
              allows students to self explore with over 2000 books to choose from.

              Students come to the educational system with a variety of needs, interests and strengths. But technology has something for pretty much 
              everyone. For students that require visual assistance there are ways to adjust the font to a bigger size. You can use programming that 
              reads the material to the student which assists with students who have visual challenges or even processing challenges. For students that 
              English is not their first language you can use virtual "word walls" that they can click words they don't understand and it shows them a 
              visual example as well explains the term. You can even do this using the students home language.
