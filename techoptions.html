              When learning how to effectively integrate technological resources into the classroom you might be looking for resources. There are 
              a variety of articles that can be used to research ways to tie these things together. One method of finding the resources is simply 
              googling scholarly articles using google scholar. There are an abundance of peer reviewed articles that show methods of integrating 
              education with technology as well as proven benefits. Www.google.scholar.com
            </p>
            <h3 class="mb-4">Resource 2</h3>
            <img
              class="img-fluid rounded w-50 float-right ml-4 mb-3"
              src="img/blog-2.jpg"
              alt="Image"
            />
            <p>
              Another resource that can demonstrate integrating technology within education is www.edutopia.org. This website hosts thoughtfully 
              written articles from teachers and educators that have found success. There are numerous articles and videos on the topic of education 
              and technology and there are many of the common concerns discussed as well as solutions to combat them listed within. 
            </p>
            <h3 class="mb-4">Resource 3</h3>
            <img
              class="img-fluid rounded w-50 float-left mr-4 mb-3"
              src="img/blog-1.jpg"
              alt="Image"
            />
            <p>
              Lastly, a very robust article that describes thoroughly how to properly marry education and technology in a complementary and effective 
              way is https://www.brookings.edu/essay/realizing-the-promise-how-can-education-technology-improve-learning-for-all/. This website actually 
              shows you the current cycle that is occurring and how technology can change that. They demonstrate how it can be misused and the solution 
              to the problems that technology can sometimes create. They give thoughtful ideas on how to integrate technology in an engaging and effective 
              way to successfully teach and help students to retain information.

              These two methods or strategies for integrating educational technology help facilitate student learning.
            </p>
            <p>
              So now we know that technology can be used to help engage students and reach the unreachable. But what are some actionable steps 
              that can be used to do this? 
            </p>
            <h3 class="mb-4">Method 1</h3>
            <img
              class="img-fluid rounded w-50 float-left mr-4 mb-3"
              src="img/blog-1.jpg"
              alt="Image"
            />
            <p>
              One strategy that can be used to integrate technology into education is having students video themselves discussing topics that were 
              taught in class or even presenting to class mates. One example of this could be teaching your students in class about kinetic and potential 
              energy. Then as a homework assignment, have students take a video of themselves identifying potential and kinetic energy examples in their 
              own environment. An application that can be used to do this is flip grid. Flip grid is an online forum that allows you to see your 
              classmates videos and post your own. You can use this by generalizing things outside of the classroom or even use it to present unit 
              projects. You can show everyone's videos in class or have them view each others! It is a method of engaging students and can be used 
              across skill level. Here is an example of my video introducing the topic! 
            </p>
            <h3 class="mb-4">Method 2</h3>
            <img
              class="img-fluid rounded w-50 float-right ml-4 mb-3"
              src="img/blog-2.jpg"
              alt="Image"
            />
            <p>
              Another strategy that can be used for the purpose to integrate technology is by using online games or quizzes. Within the classroom 
              you can create your own game show or interactive quiz and have your students divided up into two separate teams. This will allow students 
              to engage in the material and will allow you to assess ongoing understanding of the content so that you can make meaningful adjustments 
              if needed.
